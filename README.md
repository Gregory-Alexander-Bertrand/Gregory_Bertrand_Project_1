# An Engagement on the High Seas!

### Overview & Summary:

#### I will be making your standard Battleship game, hopefully with a few variations. The game will be player VS. computer, with each having their own boards to display their ships. The computer will place its ships onload(player will not see where ships are placed) while the player will have a choice on where to play their ships. The game will proceed in the standard way, with each party having their turn to guess a cell where the other party's ship is in order to score a hit.

### Why Battleship?

#### First off, it's a challange that I think I will be able to face. Second, it has been and idea kicking around in my head for some time now. Third, and this is going a little into my stretch goals, it lends itself into having a story that could enage the user.

### Game Rules

#### Size of grid is yet to be determined, but both the computer and the player will have a fleet of five ships: Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Destroyer and Cruiser. From largest to smallest the ships size will be Aircraft Carrier to Cruiser. At the start the player chooses where to put their ships while the computer puts its ships at random. Once the ships are placed, the game begins. It's played on a turn by turn basis, so the player goes first, declaring its choice by clicking somewhere on the grid. If it's a miss, the turn will be registered as a miss, if it's a hit, the turn will register as a hit. The same rules apply for the computer. The end of the game occurs when one side has lost its entire fleet of ships, or one side runs out of ammo(will explain in stretch goals.

### MVP

#### Two seperate boards in the form of a grid.
#### Grids/Boards should be large enough for at least ONE ship to be placed. Each ship could fit in one space.
#### Each square in the grid must be clickable with a way for the user to know it has been clicked.
#### Computer ships must be invisible to the player!
#### Player must be able to see their ships.
#### Message for when click is a hit & or a miss.   
#### Message for when player wins or loses.

### Stretch goals
#### An intro text crawl(think Star Wars) explaining the story.
#### A way to track how much ammo each ship has. If the player or computer runs out of ammo before the opponents fleet is destroyed it will be counted as a loss.
#### A box appearing somewhere on screen describing what happens when a ship is hit. For example, the computer scores a hit on the player's Battleship, a message might read "hit to the starboard side, compartment 8 has begun to flood." Or something of the like.
#### Pictures of actual ships, instead of boring square boxes.
#### Sound effects: explosions, waves, alarms, etc.

### User Stories
#### The first screen the player sees is a start button.
#### When the player clicks the start button, they are taken to the next screen where they will see two grid-boards side by side, each of them labeled with letters on the side and numbers on top.
#### On screen, the player will see a text box explaining the rules.
#### Once the player reads the rules, they will be prompted to place their ships on the board wherever they would like.
#### Once all the player's ships are placed, the game begins.
#### The player will have a chance to guess where the computer's ships are first. They will do this by selecting a spot anywhere on the grid. If they score a hit, the square will be highligthed as red and a message saying "hit" will display on screen. If it's a miss, the square will remain it's original color and a message saying "miss" will display on screen.
#### The computer will then have its turn to guess where they player placed their ships, with the same parameters applying as above.
#### This back an fourth will continue until either side's ships all register as hit. At which point, the game is over.
#### Whether there is a win or a loss, the player will be prompted to play again.
