# An Engagement on the High Seas!

### Overview & Summary:

#### I will be making your standard Battleship game, hopefully with a few variations. The game will be player VS. computer, with each having their own boards to display their ships. The computer will place its ships onload(player will not see where ships are placed) while the player will have a choice on where to play their ships. The game will proceed in the standard way, with each party having their turn to guess a cell where the other party's ship is in order to score a hit.

### Why Battleship?
